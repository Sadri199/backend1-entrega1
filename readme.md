## 🧾 Comments

- `/db` has 2 the jsons with preloaded data.

- `Backend 1 Entrega.postman_collection.json` is the Postman Collection with all the different requests. I don't know why i'm adding this but hey, it's free.

- I know this is poorly optimized, but I don't have much time left so, sorry. I realize that the "random IDs" are tied to the instance of the Classes execution, so whenever the server is open, those numbers become fixed until the server is closed again. No idea how to fix it (sorry again (┬┬﹏┬┬) )
